#I have a plan for coding here which is related to the field of machine learning and computer vision.
#The first plan is a machine learning related project which is used to detect the salient features such as eyes on our faces.
#I try to do like that:
#Step 1: train a face detector by using a classifier such as AdaBoost or SVM
#Step 2: capture the salient features of the faces by using the geometrical constraints and feature retrieving method
#such as SIFT and other methods.
#Step 3: try to organize the captured features on the face to train a model which can represent the salient feature 
#seperately or together.
#Step 4: I recommend the model such DPM, ISM to capture the features on the face.
#Step 5: Using what you get to detect the image and get what you want to get.
